# <Amy's Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- This project helped me learn to code as a beginner in the industry of web development.
- I built this project knowing it would be the first of many in my future career as a web developer.
- The applications and code I have learned doing this project helped me find solutions to note taking and oroganized me for future success in the UT bootcamp.
- I learned how to use github, build a repository and launch a webpage to refer to and remember and show where I first started out on this journey.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if I open the DevTools console, I can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and I will be able choose one topic to study first. The notes will help me later in bootcamp once it starts. This is a very excitng and interactive way to learn and immediately apply skills. I will be able to continue to use this project to add notes as I study. The oraganization and user friendly guide is a great benefit.

## Credits

My mentor Pete has helped me along this journey via text conversations and I will include a link to his github once I have it.
